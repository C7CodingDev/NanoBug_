## About
I am a 9 year old that loves to code.
I know css,html,python,code.org and scratch!
I started coding when i was 7 i think.
The first language i learnt was python
Here is a example of one of my codes
```python
from random import choice
password_numbers = ['123','936','563','794']
password_letters = ['a','gdfsg','hdu','bds']
for i in range(3):
print(choice(password_numbers)+choice(password_letters))
```
